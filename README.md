Processing Chain
----------------

1.  Select Station folder to be processed
2.  Filter Event Directories

    Function SortEventDirs.m selects only those directories
    which have just numbers as their name. This should 
    leave out directories with names such as 'test'.

3.  Convert sac file format

    Function ConvertTraces uses the function readsac.m to
    read in sac data. This data is then sent to freetran
    to rotate the coordinates from r and z into p and s.
    header file infor is saved into cell array 'header' and
    slowness p values are sent to vector 'pslows'

4.  Window with Taper and fft signal.

    p data is windowed with a tukey taper and passed through 
    the fft algorithm into 'wft' with fft'd s trace vectors 
    going into 'vft'.

5.  Sort Traces into Pbins.

    Right now an logical index array is created. Each line in the
    array is associated with a pbin, and it's columns are the 
    zeros and ones which select the appropriate trace that corrisponds
    to this bin.

6.  Stack and Deconvolve

    The sorted fourier transformed signals are sent into simdecf.m
    to be deconvolved into what should be something like a greens
    function. These are saved in 'rft' which is passed through the
    inverse fourier transform to recover 'Rtrace'.

### Tuning and Testing
*   Run testing on pbin logical index array.
*   Filter out and flag poorly picked traces.
*   Streamline workflow.
*   Move on to next stage in project.

Continued development of the Bostock-Kumar stacking approach may yield Vp estimates for geological regions without active source Vp data. This will allow more detailed interrogation of the Canadian crust and may provide additional constraints on crustal production models. 

The current data set should allow several avenues of investigation. First, certain specific seismic station Poisson's ratio anomalies appear consistent over multiple processing regimes and therefore may be analyzed within the context of their geological setting. Second, in areas with higher station density transect profiles can be built across geological features which may assist in interpretation of feature boundaries. Finally, developing ternary or quaternary plot representations with well chosen end-members could provide estimates for site specific bulk crustal composition.

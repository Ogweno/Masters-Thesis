% FUNCTION CONVERTFILTERTRACES(DLIST,STATION)
% Converts from sac to Matlab format, rotates coords, collects headers.
% Uses function readsac.m to convert from sac to matlab formats, stores
% header information of each trace. Rotates coordinates from r and z to p
% and s using the function freetran.m
% DLIST is the list of directories to be processed. These should contain
% the sac files and not other directories holding the sac files, ie it is
% not recursive.
% STATION is the name of the station being processed, this is used in the
% saving of the .mat file holding the processed data (3 variables ptrace
% strace and header).
% RFILE is the sac radial component file name
% ZFILE is the sac vertical component file name
% Both of these should have been previously standardized
% SAVEFLAG > 0 means that we save the data in the appropriate directory

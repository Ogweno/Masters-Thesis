Read 'doc' and 'tau.man' and 'amessage.txt' for documentation on the tau/p 
software that makes tau/p tables once and then interpolates them using 
the program ttimes or the MATLAB MEX file get_tt.mex4.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

type :  

grep -n 'data modnam' *.f 

which returns:

emiasp91.f:13:      data modnam/'/u4/seis/MATLAB/tau_p/iasp91'/
emsp6.f:13:      data modnam/'mdsp6'/
get_tt.f:194:      data modnam/'/u4/seis/MATLAB/tau_p/iasp91'/,in/1/,
ttimes.f:9:      data modnam/'/u4/seis/MATLAB/tau_p/iasp91'/

Edit these three files and change the directory name to point
to the absolute directory name for your computer.  

make the four programs remodl, setbrn, ttimes and get_tt.mex4
by typing:  (you will need to have matlab installed to build get_tt.f)

make all

run remodl and setbrn in that order (neither program requires any arguments)
these programs build the tau/p tables for the iasp91 model.

remodl
setbrn
 
clean up unnecessary files: 

make clean

You are done!

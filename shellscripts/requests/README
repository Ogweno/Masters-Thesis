TO REQUEST DATA

1. Go to IRIS event catalogue: http://www.iris.edu/SeismiQuery/sq-events.htm
2. Choose time limits,  minimum magnitude threshld >= 6.0 (?), and specify view  WEED file.
3. Cut and paste contents of WEED file into e.g. dum.weed
4. Run following command to generate a file showing azimuths and epicentral distances to S Vancouver Island
    
    weed2spyder.sh dum.weed | rdneic -s -125 48.5 > event.list

5. Use UNIX sort to cull events to include only those of interest (for teleseismic P, from 30 to 100 degrees)
   notes: last field is back azimuth. Want anything within the 30->100 & 260->330 range.

      cat event.list | sort -nk8 | awk '{ if ( ($7 >= 30 && $7 <= 100) ) print $0}'

6. Paste desired events into evmail.sh and run to request data from CNSN/GSC/ETS/POLARIS stations (you may 
want to restrict what stations are requested. File cnsn.list contains an up-to-date listing of stations and 
for what periods data are available for.
7. Paste desired events into breq_usa.sh and run to request data from IRIS/US stations.
8. Run events through getFTP.sh to aquire data from server.
9. Transform SEED to SAC and move into network/station/event/component.sac file structure. 
   
   rdseed -df <seedfile.seed>

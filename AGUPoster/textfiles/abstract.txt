It has been suggested that processes driving crustal formation in the Archean and Proterozoic were dissimilar and produced crusts with unique bulk properties and average thicknesses. Existing models based on fractionating mantle composition or evolving mantle convection require accurate estimates of the geological and geophysical properties of crustal provinces to better understand the details of early continental formation (R. Durrheim, W. Mooney, 1991). Fifteen years of publicly accessible teleseismic data from all available Canadian seismic stations are binned in horizontal slowness and deconvolved into receiver functions. A new stacking method (Bostock and Kumar, 2010) is investigated to retrieve estimates of bulk crustal velocities (Vp, Vs) and thickness H from these data under the assumption of 1-D structure. Final data analysis used in the histograms is provided by the Zhu and Kanamori (2000) stacking approach with Vp data from an active source compilation (Mooney 2012). Bootstrap error analysis is performed for each station dataset using two-standard deviation. Cross-analyzing these results with the mineral and rock seismic property database of Christensen (1996) will afford improved constraints on bulk geological composition of the Canadian landmass. These results will be used to evaluate competing models of crustal formation.

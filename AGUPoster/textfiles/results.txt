This preliminary look at the processed dataset compares results to existing crustal formation literature. The data which was processed using the Bostock and Kumar (2010) stacking approach shows good correlation with active source data for the cleanest seismic stations. For stations of less than optimum quality the correlation is poor and the procedure shows correlation between crustal thickness (H) and compressional wave velocity (Vp) estimates which represents a trade off in the calculations owing to low sensitivity of Vp to seismic wave travel time. For this reason active source data compiled by W. Mooney (2012) has been employed for bulk calculations instead of data calculated from the Bostock and Kumar (2010) method.

All available Canadian broadband seismic stations with sufficient data are processed using a stacking approach similar to Kanamori (2000). Of 239 seismic stations processed, 146 have clear multiples and standard deviations acceptable for use in the study. Histograms of Poisson's ratio and Vp estimates are provided for regions of interest as well as for regions associated with crustal formation in the Archean and Proterozoic. Each histogram plot also contains the geometric mean of the data or, where possible, an area weighted average computed using a Voronoi method.

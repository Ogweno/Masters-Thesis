- Data and Methods
  - (What is the data)
    - Analysis of bulk Canadian continental crust require parameter estimates
    - Estimates come from processing of seismograms into receiver functions
    - Additional estimates from Crust 2.0 database and an active source compilation.

  - Parameter Estimates from Teleseismic Data
    - P-wave Teleseismic
    - Broadband
    - When 2000 to 2012
    - All networks including CNSN, Polaris, FedNor and Chasme
    - 343 Seismic stations
    - More than 700 EQ sources
    - at each station sources selected if within 30 to 100 degree epicentral distance window
    - Total of 80,000 events
    - Transformed into RFs

  - (How)
    - Two RF transformation algorithms used, one well tested, another not yet employed at scale
    - Both methods utilize the S-wave reflected phases and the travel time difference to the
      direct P-wave arrival
    - [!Figure: Reflected phases]
    - [!Equation: Travel Times]
    - Strong Reflected phases at sharp velocity contrasts, for this study the boundary of interest
      is the Moho
    - Seperation of P and S wave energy is performed by rotating coordinates into radial and
      transverse dimensions and then transforming them in to P, SV and SH components with a
      wave field decomposition transfer matrix (Bostock, 1998).
    - Direct arrival used as an estimate for the source function and deconvolved from the S-wave
    - Deconvolution approach is an L2 freq domain which performs quickly and makes no
      assumptions on the noise in the data
    - [!Equation: Deconvolution]
    - Method minimize GCV(r) where r is used as ... explain Equation.
      (Bostock, 1998; Golub et al., 1979)
    - Decon produces an approximation to the S-component of the Earth's Green's function,
      (receiver function).
    - This receiver function has energy located at the times corrisponding to the reflected
      S-wave arrivals in the seismogram
    - RF is filtered between 0.04Hz and 3.0Hz
    - These RF's are used as the data for two parameter estimation methods

    - Vp/Vs method
      - Zhu and Kanamori (2000), hereafter ZK, proposed a method for extracting the ratio, R,
        of P-wave velocity to S-wave velocity, R = Vp/Vs, as well as crustal thickness, H,
        from receiver functions.
      - Method involves stacking RFs along trial moveout curves for a range of candidate models
        of R and H.
      - Model requires an apriori assumption on crustal P-velocity, Vp, and will tradeoff to
        some degree with crustal thickness H. Using the Crust 2.0 Vp estimate at each station.
      - Each phase is weighted based on the general trend in quality, with direct arrivals
        usually carrying the best signal followed by the PpPs and finally PpSs.
      - Weights used for all processing are w1 = 0.5, w2 = 0.3, w3 = 0.2 for the Ps, PpPs and PpSs
        phases respectively.
      - Semblance weighting (Eaton, 2006) used to reduce the effect of spurious large amplitude
        noise in the data.
      - [!Equation: Semblance]
      - Semblance function ranges between zero for incoherent noise and one for a coherent signal
      - Adding this additional wieghting shown by Eaton to provide sharper resolution when
        selecting between stacked models.
      - The model which stacks the most coherent energy is used to provide the best estimates
        for R and H.


    - Vp method
      - Method which allows for estimates of Vp and Vs uniquely (Bostock and Kumar, 2010)
        hereafter BK
      - Does not require apriori assumption on Vp
      - Linear dependence on H in equations can be removed by dividing reflected phases with
        the direct arrival
      - [!Equation: BK travel time equations]
      - Similar to stacking method of ZK, requires an estimate for tps
      - Grid search for R and Vp
      - Line search for H
      - Several methods for choosing tps are available
        - tps should represent the most prominent phase of the ____ and its arrival,
          depending on Moho depth, should fall within the window of 3 to 6 seconds.
          With low moveout one may therefore select the time corresponding to maximum
          amplitude within a given window as an estimate of tps.
        - An alternative approach is to use max amplititude estimates as data in a
          non-linear optimization to find the R, Vp and H which mimimize the residual
          between tps and the data. The travel time equations are twice-differentiable so
          the quadratically convergent Newton's method may be employed. This approach has
          the advantage that noise leading to poor maximum amplitude picks are effectively
          collapsed onto the curve corresponding to the travel time function.
        - The problem size is relatively small and performing a full 3D gridsearch over Vp Vs
          and H affords the advantages of both the ZK and BK approaches. No requirements for
          an estimate of tps or Vp and provides estimates for Vp and Vs uniquely as well as H.
          The computational expense is felt computing statistical estimates for the error

    - Error calculations
      - Error calculations are performed with bootstrap resampling by rerunning the
        processing with randomly receiver functions, with replacement, 1024 times.
        The error is obtained by taking the standard deviation of the results

  - Vp database
    - Estimates for Vp and H from compiled active source data
    - Walter Mooney (Personal communication 2012)
    - Provides some information in areas with sparse seismic station coverage

  - Crust 2.0
    - Crust 2.0 provides statistically averaged estimates of Vp, Vs and H
    - Data relies on many sources, active and teleseismic
    - Provides reference values for locally computed estimates

    - Comparison Discussion
      - Crustal Thickness
        - Very good correlation in thickness estimates with all three datasets.
      - Vp/Vs
        - Lower correlation with the Vp/Vs values.
          - Expect lower correlation with Vp/Vs since the travel time equations are
            less sensitive to seismic velocities than they are to crustal thickness.
            This means that there will be more uncertainty during the parameter
            search for Vp/Vs and hence higher degree of relative error.
          - ??? Utilizing different sources, applying different deconvolution and
            filtering techniques will therefore have a greater impact on the
            uncertainty of picking Vp/Vs than that of crustal thickness H.

  - Regional Bulk Crustal Parameters
    - All following data has been utilized using only those stations with less than
      than +/-0.06 stdR bootstrap error.
    - Averaging station crustal parameter estimates requires a scheme to account for
      the uneven geographic distribution of stations. Stations that cluster together in
      space should account for less of the total than those stations who are sampling a
      much larger region.
      - A Weighting scheme is calculated as follows:
        - Stations are projected onto the 2D plane using the Albers equal-area conic projection.
        - A voronoi diagram is calculated for all projected station locations.
        - The ratio between the voronoi cell surface encompassing each station and the
          total area of the bounding region is computed and used as the weighting value.
        - Station parameter values are multiplied by the wieghts and then summed.
    - Canada wieghted crustal thickness average is 37.0 km.
      - Previous estimates for Canadian Crustal averages are 38 km (Perry, 2002) and

The preliminary interrogation of the data set yields the observation that the bulk Canadian crust is more felsic than originally anticipated. Original global estimates provided by Nik Christensen (1996) have a Poisson's ratio of 0.265 while the weighted average for this data set shows a Poisson' ratio of 0.258. Most of the Canadian Shield stations follow this same trend except for the Grenville Province which has a high Poisson Ratio of 0.275. 

The data bears out earlier results showing Proterozoic crust to have a higher Poisson's ratio than Archean crust, likely the result of a more mafic composition. The increased crustal thickness of Proterozoic crust is clearly seen in the active source data while it not visible in data from processed seismic stations. The most likely reason for not seeing the signal of thicker crust in the station data is owing to poor station coverage in Proterozoic regions.

Further work on the Bostock-Kumar stacking approach is warranted from a look at the cleanest stations. Before it can be employed in large scale analysis additional denoising methods or alternative deconvolution techniques will need to be investigated to reduce the noise in the data.

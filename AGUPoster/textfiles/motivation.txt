Many stacking techniques require an initial P-wave velocity value (Vp) and provide an estimate of the Vp/Vs ratio. In the 2010 paper "Bias in seismic estimates of crustal properties" by M. Bostock and R. Kumar, a fast 2D stacking approach which is not dependent on an initial Vp estimate is outlined. The algorithm returns estimates of Vp as well as the Vp/Vs ratio and - after a 1D line search - crustal thickness H. For geological regions with anomalous Vp, this approach may provide more accurate estimates of crustal parameters.

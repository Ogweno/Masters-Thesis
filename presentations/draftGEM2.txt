Hi everyone and thank you for opportunity to present some of my work. Presentations like this are always a great opportunity for graduate students. As David mentioned I will be taking you on a quick tour through a dataset I have processed over the last year. It is part of a larger tomographic study of the Canadian Lithosphere. My side of the project was to churn through as much available seismic data as possible to provide estimates for the crustal thickness as well as crustal properties such as Poisson's Ratio. We are going to take a quick look at the data across Canada, look at comparisons with regional data sets for quality control and take note of any interesting features. An important crustal parameter used in many imaging studies is the compressional wave speed, Vp. I will also show some of the conclusions of an attempt to isolate Vp out of the Poisson Ratio.

   Seismic data utilized in this study come from 343 stations across Canada from all available networks. Of course this is far from the USArray, which we will hear about later on. [ Show large scale version of map w/ all seismic stations ]. We have clustering of stations around areas of geological resource and research interest, high accessibility and of course, civilization centres. Many regions are extremely sparsely represented. Of these stations 146 are of sufficient quality to be useful for study. [Show processed-ok Processed not-ok]. The stations in bright green have an estimated error low enough to include in further research. I will show some examples of clean and noisy stations later on.

   All stations are broadband with data selected between the years 2000 and 2012, for a total of more than 700 earthquake sources. The data was processed using a receiver function method, which I will outline extremely briefly since it was discussed in detail at last year's conference. The basic idea is that one can utilize the fact that seismic wave are composed of separate components, two of which are the P-wave and the S-wave. Comparing arrival times of the initial direct arrival and the Moho reflected arrivals of the slower S-component of a seismic wave to the time of the initial P-arrival tells us something about the crustal parameters. Since we know the theoretical travel times, at least under some fairly limiting assumptions, we can find the set of parameters that best match the data. [ Show the RF function ]. So here we have the initial S-wave arrival, and here is the reflected phase, the one that hit the surface and reflected off the Moho before being registered on the seismometer. The reason there are two arrivals for this reflected phases is that at a discontinuous boundary like the Moho the seismic wave can transform from an S-wave to a P-wave and vice versa, so the energy that spends more time as the slower S phase will arrive after the energy that spent more of the journey as a P-wave.

  [Show map with processed-ok stations] Displayed on the map with the green triangles are the seismic stations that were processed with an error of less than +/- 0.055 Vp/Vs. A number that was chosen somewhat arbitrarily but contains the set of stations with clearly discernible multiples. A study published in 2010 by Thompson, Snyder and Bastow et. al. looked at 34 stations in the Hudson Bay area, which you can see in red [Show map with Thompson data overlay]. Comparing the two data sets we see that there is a correlation between the two of about 0.5. [show map + comparison figure].
